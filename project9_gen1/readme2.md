Welcome to the future or alternative to the mainstream in some scenarios.

Modern hardware architectures (like X86 or ARM) are very impressive, but have
some problems with security, complexity, intellectual property and/or government
control. Risc-V wants to avoid this, but when you look into specs, you will
see, that various elements and/or extensions have potentially doing the same
problems (see words from Linus Torvalds "Theyâ€™ll have all
the same issues we have on the Arm side and that x86 had before them").

This project contains 1st working generation of the PL SoC (System On Chip).
It was initially created to check, how to create some hardware solutions
(+ to proove, that some hardware based solutions can be better
than software based one).

PL1 allows for creating and running OS and apps:

1. without kernel
2. with full protecting resources (you don't have hypervisor mode and other
stuff, which in the end is always compromised)
3. without various unnecessary operations (like copying memory during
interrupt or dumping things in ineffective way during task switch)

This is done without legacy stuff, which is big advantage (when you don't
have something, it cannot be broken).

Current implementation:

1. has got support for RS-232 output
2. has got OS concept directly in the bootloader
3. doesn't have deep pipelining (planned in short future), asynchrononous design
(planned in longer future) and support for video/SDCard/RS-232 input/Ethernet/DDRx
(planned)
4. has got probably many FPGA design mistakes (they're removed step by step)
5. works in the Artix-7 Nexys Video board

MMU

MMU is using pages and two memories:

* mmu_chain_memory - next physical segment index for process
* mmu_logical_pages_memory - logical process page assigned to physical segment

Every process process has got start point (mmu_start_process_physical_segment),
which shows, what is index for first entry in both memories. To save time during
process switch we use start point equal of index of memory page with logical page 0

mmu_chain_memory is sorted during each searching for memory page - last
found index is moved into beginning of the chain.

special cases:
  // mmu_chain_memory == own physical segment (element is pointing to itself) -> end segment
  // mmu_logical_pages_memory == start point in segment 0 when process is not executed
  // mmu_logical_pages_memory == 0 && mmu_chain_memory == 0 -> free segment for all physical segments != 0 (see note in next line)
  // 0,0 can be assigned to process starting from physical segment 0 -> we handle it with mmu_first_possible_free_physical_segment
