**Welcome to the future or at least some alternative to the mainstream.**

Modern hardware (like X86 or ARM) is very impressive, but has got
some problems with security, complexity, intellectual property and/or government
control. Risc-V wants to avoid this, but when you look into [specs](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/), you will
see, that various elements and/or extensions are complex or
have potentially the same problems (see words from Linus Torvalds "Theyâ€™ll have all
the same issues we have on the Arm side and that x86 had before them").

This project contains first working version or generation of the PL1 SoC (System On Chip).

PL1 currently allows for creating and running OS and apps:

1. without kernel
2. with full protecting resources
3. without many unnecessary operations

Applications are communicating with each other using interrupts + memory
sharing. There are no other ways for doing this & you don't have kernel
or hypervisor mode, which is big advantage (when you don't have something, it cannot be broken).

**Current implementation**

1. has got support for RS-232 output
2. has got OS concept directly in the bootloader
3. doesn't have deep pipelining (planned in short future), asynchrononous design and multicore support (planned in longer future) and support for video/SDCard/RS-232 input/Ethernet/DDRx (planned)
4. has got many FPGA design mistakes (they're removed step by step)
5. works in the [Artix-7 Nexys Video FPGA board](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-video/reference-manual)

**Statistics**

**Instruction set**

Format:

* First 8 bits - instruction code
* Next 24 bits - instruction parameters

Instructions:

* OPCODE_JMP = 1;  //24 bit target address
* OPCODE_JMP16 = 2;  //x, register num with target addr (we read one reg)
*  // OPCODE_JMP32 = 3;  //x, first register num with target addr (we read two reg)
*  // OPCODE_JMP64 = 4;  //x, first register num with target addr (we read four reg)  
* OPCODE_JMP_PLUS = 5;  //x, 16 bit how many instructions
* OPCODE_JMP_PLUS16 = 6;  //x, register num with info (we read one reg)
* OPCODE_JMP_MINUS = 7;  //x, 16 bit how many instructions  
* OPCODE_JMP_MINUS16 = 8;  //x, register num with info (we read one reg)
* OPCODE_RAM2REG = 9;  //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit source addr //ram -> reg
* OPCODE_RAM2REG16 = 'ha; //start register num, how many registers, register num with source addr (we read one reg), //ram -> reg  
* // OPCODE_RAM2REG32 = 11; //start register num, how many registers, first register num with source addr (we read two reg), //ram -> reg
* // OPCODE_RAM2REG64 = 12; //start register num, how many registers, first register num with source addr (we read four reg), //ram -> reg
* OPCODE_REG2RAM = 'he; //14 //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit target addr //reg -> ram
* OPCODE_REG2RAM16 = 'hf; //15 //start register num, how many registers, register num with target addr (we read one reg), //reg -> ram
* // OPCODE_REG2RAM32 = 16; //start register num, how many registers, first register num with target addr (we read two reg), //reg -> ram

* OPCODE_NUM2REG = 'h12; //18;  //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit value //value -> reg
* OPCODE_REG_PLUS = 'h14;//20; //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit value // reg += value
* OPCODE_REG_MINUS = 'h15; //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit value  //reg -= value
* OPCODE_REG_MUL = 'h16; //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit value // reg *= value
* OPCODE_REG_DIV ='h17; //register num (5 bits), how many-1 (3 bits), 16 bit value  //reg /= value
* OPCODE_EXIT = 'h18;  //exit process
* OPCODE_PROC = 'h19;  //new process //how many segments, start segment number (16 bit)
* OPCODE_REG_INT = 'h1a;  //int number (8 bit), start memory page, end memory page 
* OPCODE_INT = 'h1b;  //int number (8 bit), start memory page, end memory page
* OPCODE_INT_RET = 'h1c;  //int number

**MMU**

MMU is handling RAM paging (for testing purposes every page has got 100 bytes) and in current memory has got only
one memory mmu_free_page, the real mapping is saved in RAM:

In process segment 0 we have

* mmu_segment_length,
* physical segment address for mmu logical page 1 or 0 (not assigned)
* physical segment address for mmu logical page 2 or 0 (not assigned)
* ...
* physical segment address for mmu logical page n or 0 (not assigned)
* address of next mmu segment

Next MMU segments have the whole segment for the MMU:

* mmu_segment_length (how many entries are initialited)
* physical segment address for mmu logical page n+1 or 0 (not assigned)
* physical segment address for mmu logical page n+2 or 0 (not assigned)
* ...
* address of next mmu segment

MMU just needs to find correct page and read value from value indexed by logical page number.

**Process memory**

In the first process page we save on beginning few elements:

* 4 16-bit bytes with address of next process (current PL1 is using just one byte, other are reserved)
* 4 16-bit bytes with logical PC value
* 2 16-bit bytes with information, which registers have values different than zero (one bit - one register)
* 32 16-bit bytes with register values

**Process switching**

Every modern CPU / OS is running many processes in parallel. Software based switching gives flexibility, but... it can be not so effective like hardware one.

1. PL1 has got tables, where can save state of few processes (when one of them exist in the table, switching length is similiar to executing ONE instruction)
2. when process info is not found in tables, we try to read only these registers from memory, which have value different than zero

PL1 is building in the memory one way list with the process addresses and switching to next one just specified number of instructions (in the future we will count number of cycles and / or have priorities). Process registered for interrupt is excluded during exuection, when we execute interrupt, we switch called process with interrupt process in this chain.

**My development environment**

1. free Ubuntu
2. free Vivado version from https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html (needs free registration;
after installing needs installing drivers for cables and adding board definition;
update tool can be started with binary xic/xic)
3. board

**It doesn't have any sense**

I will remind you August 1991 and Linus Torvalds:

"I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things)."

Today we have Linux kernel on desktops, in phones and many other devices.

Who knows, maybe PL1 will help in creating next gen solutions?

Even now it looks very promising + gives very big fun, when works :)
